From this directory, just type "bash run.sh" to run the program.

Resulting .mp4 videos will be in ./video_out, while output frames will be in
different folders depending on the implementation. (ex: ./12serial_out)

If you want to test a different video, it must be called "input.mp4" and be placed
in ./input/
